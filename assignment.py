# Write a program that asks the user to enter 8 numeric tests scores (out of 100 for each test). The program should calculate the average of the 8 numeric scores and then display a corresponding letter grade.

# Write the following functions in the program:

# calc_average - this function should ask the user for 8 test scores and return the average.

# determine_grade - this function should accept a test score average as an argument and return a letter grade for the score based on the following grading scale:

# 90-100A80-89B70-79C60-69DBelow 60F

# convert avg to integer and return the value. Do NOT change
#return int(avg)


# Do NOT change the function header determine_grade(score)
#def determine_grade(score):

# Convert the numeric score into letter grade

# 90-100: A

# 80-89: B

# 70-79: C

# 60-69: D

# below 60: F
#return grade

# Do NOT change any of the lines below
#def main():



# avg = calc_average()
# grade = determine_grade(avg)
# print ("Your average grade is:", grade)
